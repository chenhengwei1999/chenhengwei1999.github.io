## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Hi, I am currently a research assistant at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), working with algorithm development for automated agents, such as robots and cars.

In terms of scientific research, I mainly focus on the adversarial robustness of neural network based 3D perceptual models, specifically finding adversarial samples and out-of-distribution data that make 3D perceptual models fail, so as to increase the usability of 3D perceptual algorithms in real-world scenarios.

The 3D perceptual model mentioned above refers to, in addition to the traditional 3D object detection, i.e., representing objects as 3D cubes, i.e., bounding boxes. It also contains a 3D semantic and occupancy prediction network that predicts whether any point in 3D space is occupied or not as well as its semantics.


## Research Interest

Overall, I would like to integrate the theoretical models, mostly based on neural networks, with the practical, so as to examine its usability and improve its performance by finding its shortcomings in practical situations.

Specifically, current research interests are in neural network based 3D perceptual models for automated agents, with a focus on automobiles. From an experimental perspective, it is expected to mine more valuable adversarial samples (mainly artificially generated), and out-of-distribution samples (mainly natural samples).
